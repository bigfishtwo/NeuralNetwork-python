# NeuralNetwork-python
Neural Network from scratch in Python

# Prerequisites
- Python
- Numpy
- Scipy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- PIL

# Introduction
In `main.py` a simple neural network with one convolutional layer and two fully connected layers.
All code can run without problem, but due to numerical unstability loss value might be inf. Please tell me if anyone has a solution. 

# Usage
To add layers to neural network and train it: `python3 main.py`
